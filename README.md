# CISS360_X86_Assembly
CISS360 Assembly course at Columbia College

This course was really fun. I learned alot about where 
data is actually stored, and how to manipulate it. 
It especially helped me with c++ assignments in the future, 
and my conmputer security class where I learned how this 
data can be exploited if you know where it is.

The syllabus lists the topics covered:
Introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer 
systems including data representation, computer arithmetic, 
Boolean algebra, SSI Logic Design, register-transfer and 
micro-operations, computer organization, assemblers and 
assembly language programming.
